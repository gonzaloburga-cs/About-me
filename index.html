            <br>A poem about what I must do:<br>

            <br>

            <em>I type and I type</em><br>

            <br>

            <em>Is that a rumble I hear</em><br>

            <em>It must be time for food</em>

        <h2>My Personal Intrests:</h2>
        <p>
            I like to play sports. I've been playing sports since I was a little kid, I started with soccer then swimming,
            basketabll, karate, and back to soccer. Skiing and snowboarding too during the winter time. Playing sports has 
            always been a big part of my life but I'm slowly starting to see less and less free time for sports.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also like to play video games in my free time. I used to not play that much because I wasn't very good so I would
            only play with when I was with all my friends, but then COVID gave me a lot of time to improve and I found the same 
            level of competitveness that I had with sports. Now most recently I play Halo Infinte for the UVU eSports team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another one of my hobbies is cars. I've grown up around cars my entire life since my dad is a mechanic. 
            Ever since I was around 8 years old he started taking my brother and I to his work shop and he would have us 
            help him whether it was us passing him a tool or actually letting us take off the tires or change the oil.
